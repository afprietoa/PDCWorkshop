# Programing, Design & Construction Workshop

This workshop contains evidence on handling abstraction, interfaces, and polymorphism in design and programming.

The program was designed with the Model - View - Controller pattern (MVC) and the Singleton pattern. The program 
has an infinite execution from a console menu in which it is possible to create the different types of spaceships.

The program code was built from the design UML diagram, which can be seen below:
